::Small list of things to do:
- Fix threading problem (convert DisableItemsThread -> Create new threads to only a single thread) [fixes 100% cpu] [TRThreads]
- Fix several dupes (Retrievulator, Tank cart, ect)
- Fix any intermediate bugs
- Fix Flying bugs (Boat, Hurricane boots, Quantum boots) [TRFlyHandler]
- Document code (aka, place comments before each segment explaining how it works... I haven't implemented this a lot because I change my code sometimes)
